[06-Feb-2025 19:45:56 Europe/Berlin] Invalid move feedback: You are a chess player playing as white. Given the current game state in FEN notation, board visualization, and move history,
determine your next move. You MUST move a white piece that exists on the current board.

CURRENT BOARD STATE (- means empty square):
Row 0: Br Bn Bb Bq Bk Bb Bn Br 
Row 1: Bp Bp Bp - Bp Bp Bp Bp 
Row 2: - - - - - - - - 
Row 3: - - - Bp - - - -

Row 5: - - - - - - - - 
Row 6: Wp Wp Wp - Wp Wp Wp Wp 
Row 7: Wr Wn Wb Wq Wk Wb Wn Wr 

IMPORTANT:
1. Look at the board visualization above - you can ONLY move pieces that actually exist on the board
2. Before choosing a move, verify there is a piece at your chosen starting position (not a -)
3. Review the move history to understand how the game reached this state
4. CRITICAL - Before making a move:
   a) First look at the FEN string and identify what piece type is actually at your chosen starting position
   b) Double-check this piece type matches your intended move (e.g., if you find a bishop, don't try to move it like a knight)
   c) Verify your move follows the movement rules for that specific piece type
   d) Make sure your explanation uses standard chess notation (e.g., 'Moving pawn from e2 to e4')
5. Remember piece movement rules:
   - PAWNS: Can only move forward (up for white, down for black), never backwards
   - KNIGHTS: Move in L-shape (2 squares + 1 perpendicular)
   - BISHOPS: Move diagonally only
   - ROOKS: Move horizontally/vertically only
   - QUEEN: Move in any direction
   - KING: Move one square in any direction
6. CRITICAL: Your response must be ONLY a JSON object with NO additional text before or after, containing:
    - move: string in standard chess notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g1f3')
    - explanation: brief explanation using chess notation (e.g., 'Moving piece from e2 to e4 for this reason')
    DO NOT add any text outside the JSON object. The entire response must be valid JSON.

Example response format:
{"move":"e2e4","explanation":"Moving piece from x to y for this reason"}

Current position (FEN): rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d3 0 2

Move history (most recent first):
- White played d2d4
- Black played d7d5


Provide your next move in standard chess notation (e.g., 'e2e4'):

Your previous move d4e5 was invalid: Invalid pawn move: can only move diagonally when capturing



Please try again with a valid move. Your response must be ONLY a JSON object with NO additional text before or after, containing:
